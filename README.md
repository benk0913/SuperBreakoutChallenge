# SuperBreakoutChallenge

** Using Unity 2021.3.16f1 & Android Support **
 
Start the game from the "Preloader" scene.

== To add a new level ==
1) Duplicate and create a new scene, design the bricks as you see fit 
2) Set bonuses on the bricks / modify their HP.
3) Go to preloader scene > game manager > campaign > add a new entry to the list.
4) Set the scene key, the music key, the lives and the timeline of effects


Bonus Content:
* Obtainable Bonuses
* Timeline of effects for every level
* Notifications
* Addressables loading content further into the game
* Loading screen
* Object pooling of effects / sounds

Development Duration:
Weekend / 2 work days.

Final note: 
I tried to use a variety of designs and approaches in the script in order to display
a wide span of tools and adaptability, this does not necessarily means these methods 
were ideal or not in specific scenarios, but that the code was affected by this bias.
